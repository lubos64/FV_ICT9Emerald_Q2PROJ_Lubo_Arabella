To ensure there are no big lumps, put the really soft butter in a small bowl and stir it with a stiff spatula. Cream the butter until creamy, then add the brown sugar. Add the flour and stir until a thick, homogeneous mixture forms.
Sandwich the craquelin dough between two baking paper sheets. Using your hands, gently flatten it, then roll it out with a rolling pin to create a thin layer that is about 2 mm (1/16 inch) thick. Put on a flat tray in the freezer and let it there for at least 30 to 1 hour, or until it is totally solid. Pastry Choux (P√¢te √† Choux)
In a medium-sized pot, place the water, butter, and sugar over medium heat.
Add the flour immediately after the butter has melted. After combining the dough with a wooden spoon, continue working the dough to extract as much moisture as you can (see to point 1). Continue to stir until a thin pellicule forms at the pot's bottom. After transferring to a big basin or the bowl of your mixer, let it cool for approximately fifteen minutes. In another basin, beat the eggs together. Add the combined eggs to the remaining choux batter gradually, a small amount at a time. Before adding a bit more, thoroughly mix until the eggs are completely combined (a stand mixer makes this step easier). Instead of being too liquid or too hard, the pastry should be shiny and fluid (see note 2).
Set your oven to 180¬∞C (350¬∞F) and butter the bottom of a baking tray. Use a paper towel to wipe away any extra grease.In a piping bag fitted with a large round nozzle, place the Choux Pastry. Because they will puff up in the oven, leave space between each choux as you pipe tiny mounds of pastry.
Taking the Craquelin out of the refrigerator is optional. Place the craquelin over each choux after cutting it out using a tiny cookie cutter that is roughly the size of each choux.
After 20 minutes, or until golden and puffy, open the oven door to release the steam and immediately close it again. Give them another ten to fifteen minutes to bake. If the Choux are not sufficiently baked, they will crumble when they get cold. Pastry Cream,
In a small pot, combine the milk and vanilla paste and bring to a simmer over low heat.
In a another bowl, mix together the egg yolks and caster sugar while the milk is heating up. Mix to incorporate the cornstarch.

While whisking, pour the warm milk over the egg yolk, sugar, and cornstarch. Then, return everything to the stove. Return to the burner and whisk constantly until the cream begins to thicken, over low heat. When the cream comes to a boil, cook for another 30 seconds and then turn off the heat. Place the cream in a shallow pot and cover with plastic wrap that touches the cream's surface. Put in the refrigerator to chill fully, which should take 30 to 60 minutes.
Optional: whisk the Heavy Cream (see note 3) until it forms firm peaks for a lighter cream. Before using, gently fold it into the chilled pastry cream and put it back in the refrigerator to set for half an hour. Putting the Choux together
Cut each Choux Bun in half with care. Fill a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle with the chilled pastry cream. After adding the Pastry Cream to each Choux, replace the Choux cover over the cream. Refer to note 4.
To complete the Choux, you can optionally dust them with icing sugar.
